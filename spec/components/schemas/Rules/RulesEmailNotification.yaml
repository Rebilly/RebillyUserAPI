    description: >
      An array of messages with the language locale identifiers according to [RFC 5646](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5646).
      A language will be selected based on the customer's locale.

      
      If there is no locale set for the customer, then `en-US` (US English) will be used as the locale.


      If there is no message with the customer's locale, 
      then a message locale will be selected by Rebilly using a closest
      match algorithm (which may be random at worst).


      If your email messages are localized into more than one language, 
      you SHOULD set a customer locale.
